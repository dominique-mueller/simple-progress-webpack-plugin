## What it does

**simple-progress-webpack-plugin** is a plugin for **[Webpack 2](https://webpack.js.org/)**. It improves the overall Webpack Developer
Experience by showing a much more detailed and also visually appealing build progress in the command line. Four different output formats are
available, from which two are ready to be used in a CI environment (such as *Travis CI*).

<br>

## How to install

To get the **simple-progress-webpack-plugin** via **npm**, simply add it as a new dev-dependency to your `package.json` file and run `npm
install`. Alternatively, run the following command:

``` bash
npm install simple-progress-webpack-plugin --save-dev
```

<br>

## How to use

First, import the plugin into your Webpack configuration file:

``` javascript
const SimpleProgressWebpackPlugin = require( 'simple-progress-webpack-plugin' );
```

Then, instantiate it within the list of plugins:

``` javascript
plugins: [
  new SimpleProgressWebpackPlugin()
]
```

<br>

## How to customize

To customize the plugin, simply pass the options in the constructor of the plugin:

``` javascript
plugins: [
  new SimpleProgressWebpackPlugin( { // Default options
    format: 'compact'
  } )
]
```

The following is a list of available logging output formats. While `compact` is the default format, `expanded` is the recommended one for
being used within a CI environment.

<br>

### `minimal`

The `minimal` logger prints everything into a single line, constantly updated during build. This makes it look pretty similar to what the
**[Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)** outputs during build. So, if you're a minimalist, this is probably the right
logger for you! *This logger format is not recommended for being used within a CI environment*.

<br>

### `compact`

The `compact` logger is the default logger. It shows each build step with further details (such as the sub-progress and several sub-steps)
while still not taking up too much space (thus the name compact). *This logger format is not recommended for being used within a CI
environment*.

<br>

### `expanded`

The `expanded` / `extended` logger is pretty similar to the `compact` logger, but prints every sub-step into its own separate line. *This
logger format can also be used within a CI environment*.

![Expanded Logger Preview GIF](/docs/expanded-logger-preview.gif?raw=true)

<br>

### `verbose`

The `verbose` / `debug` logger logs everything. Like everything. The full truth, every crucial detail Webpack has to offer. Best use it for
debugging purposes (or for finding bugs in this plugin). *This logger format can also be used within a CI environment*.

## Further recommendations

- **[Progress Bar Webpack Plugin](https://github.com/clessg/progress-bar-webpack-plugin)** is an alternative progress plugin for webpack.
However, instead of just logging out colored text it uses an animated progress bar. Perfect for anyone who likes bars more than stupid text!
- **[Friendly Errors Webpack Plugin](https://github.com/geowarin/friendly-errors-webpack-plugin)** complements either this plugin or the
*Progress Bar Webpack Plugin* described above. It gives developer a cleaner, more detailed screen once the build has finished. Definitely
worth checking out!
